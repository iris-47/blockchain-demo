# Blockchain Demonstration Program

This repository contains a blockchain demonstration program based on **imgui-sfml**. The primary focus of this project is to illustrate the **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** process.

## ðŸš€ Current Status

While the program successfully demonstrates the PBFT process, I have encountered limitations with imgui that prevent me from achieving the desired user interface effects. As a result, I have decided to discontinue using **imgui-sfml** and will transition to **Qt** for the continued development of this project.

## ðŸ’¡ Experience Gained

Despite the challenges with imgui-sfml, this project has been an excellent learning experience. It has provided me with valuable insights and skills that will be beneficial as I move forward with Qt.

Thank you for your interest in this project!

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **src/**: Source code of the blockchain demonstration.
- **src/utils**: Some API I write to use imgui-smfl more convenient
- **thirdparty/**: imgui-sfml srouce code.
